These folders form the foundation of a standard Django application structure. They provide a modular organization of code and resources, separating project-level configuration from application-specific code.

- **manage.py**: This is a command-line utility provided by Django. It is used to manage various aspects of the Django project, such as running the development server, executing database migrations, and running tests.

- **project_name**: This is the root folder of the Django project. The name of this folder is typically the same as the project's name. It contains the project-level configuration files and settings.

  - **settings.py**: This file contains the configuration settings for the Django project. It includes database settings, middleware configurations, installed applications, static and media file paths, and more.

  - **urls.py**: This file defines the URL patterns for the Django project. It maps URLs to corresponding views or endpoints within the project.

  - **wsgi.py**: This file is the entry point for running the Django project using WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface). It sets up the WSGI application object that is used by web servers to communicate with the Django application.

  - **asgi.py**: This file is the entry point for running the Django project using ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface). It sets up the ASGI application object that is used by web servers to communicate with the Django application in an asynchronous manner.

- **app_name**: This folder represents an application within the Django project. The name of this folder is typically the same as the application's name. It contains the code specific to that application.

  - **admin.py**: This file is used to register models with the Django admin site. It allows you to manage and interact with the application's models through the Django admin interface.

  - **models.py**: This file contains the application's models. Models define the structure of the database tables and provide an object-oriented interface for interacting with the data.

  - **views.py**: This file contains the application's views. Views define the logic for handling HTTP requests and generating responses. They retrieve data from models and render templates or return JSON responses.

  - **urls.py**: This file defines the URL patterns specific to the application. It maps URLs to corresponding views within the application.

  - **tests.py**: This file contains test cases for the application. It allows you to write unit tests to ensure that the application functions correctly.

  - **migrations**: This folder contains database migration files. Migrations are scripts that define changes to the database schema over time. They allow you to version and apply database schema changes easily.

- **static**: This folder is used to store static files that are served directly by the web server, such as CSS, JavaScript, or image files. These files are typically shared across multiple applications within the Django project.

- **templates**: This folder is used to store HTML templates used for rendering views. Django's template engine allows you to separate the presentation logic from the application's code.

- **media**: This folder is used to store user-uploaded media files, such as images or user-generated content. It is typically used for files that are not static and are specific to the individual users or application's content.

- **venv**: This folder (not always present) is the virtual environment folder. It contains the isolated Python environment for the project, including installed packages and dependencies.
